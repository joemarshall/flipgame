Game mechanics:
---------------
Moves are:
head,feet, front,back,left,right (on the floor)
tap tap? (tap the device twice)
consecutive moves are always different
balance of moves should be roughly the same (perhaps modulated by time differences)


each move = 
  1)name of move
  2)tick tick tick, tickticktick, buzz countdown (or 5,4,3,2,1?)
  3)BOOM (if you miss it)
  or 
  3)PING (if you hit it)
  
Each level = faster speed
LEVEL BLAH
GET READY
...
10 moves or 30 seconds? 

Every 5 levels = rest time
TAKE A REST
20 seconds
LEVEL blah
Get Ready
...

score = level * (time left for move / total time for move)
e.g. if you have 10 seconds per move in level 5, if you do it in 1 second, you get 9/10 * 5 = .9*5 = .45
*1000 and integer for nice display

Changeables:
------------
Choice of:
 starting level speed
 time per level
 change in speed per level (as a percentage? or as a raw number?)

time multipliers for some moves (e.g. head down)?
time multiplier for transition out of a move (e.g. head down -> head up?)
moves to not include (e.g. lying on back if that's where the phone is, head down if people aren't in a situation where it is possible)
grid for each move, with buttons for:
  1)not included
  2)1,1.5,2x time multiplier

pocket calibration (get base rotation matrix to correct for angle of pockets)
   - maybe do this in first few seconds of starting the game (say 'stand up straight and get ready')

Todo:
------
preferences class
game engine - 
  1)Core states = in game, front screen, prefs screen, debug screen (current frontscreen)
  2)In game state (run a game master thread for this) = 
      level, list of moves for current level, position in movelist, time in move (set after it has said 'name of move')      
      
log sensor data to file each time a game is played - including 'gamestate sensors, done each time there is a new level, or a move is hit)
      
sound engine - play bg music, play countdowns, do sounds
screen to set preferences (lower priority for now)
