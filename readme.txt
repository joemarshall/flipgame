In this game, you have to put the phone on your upper body so that it is in line with your body, 
the screen is facing away from your stomach, and the top of the phone is facing up.

You have to follow the instructions given in the game audio, these are:
FRONT             Move your body so that your front is facing the ground.  
BACK              Move your body so that your back is facing the ground
LEFT              Move your body so your left hand side is facing downwards
